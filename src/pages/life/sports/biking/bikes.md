### RIP

TREK Superfly 2013, [specs](http://archive.trekbikes.com/us/en/2013/Trek/superfly). This poor chap has been stolen :( Didn't get nearly enough single track time on it.

Schwinn World Sport 1987. My first road bike, cost $180 on Craigslist, but priceless for its character!

Author Traction 2000. So much <3 for this old pal. Thousands of miles together and many long winter weekends in my parents' basement customizing the crap out of it. You won't be forgotten my friend!

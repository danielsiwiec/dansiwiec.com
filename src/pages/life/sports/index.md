### Races
Come to join or cheer me on at my [upcoming races](sports/races/upcoming)! Also, check out some of my [recent starts](sports/races/recent)

### Snowboarding
I'm an avid boarded. During the season I spend most of the weekends riding around Lake Tahoe or in Canada. See more [here](sports/boarding)

### Swimming
I swim at the Aquatic park, in the San Francisco Bay, usually early mornings or evenings. Recently working on pushing the distance towards 2 miles.

### Biking
I enjoy long, solitary trips. Just the bike and tens of miles of spectacular Bay Area landscapes. Check out some of them [here](sports/biking/trips).

Take a peek at [bikes](sports/biking/bikes) I'm riding.

### CrossFit
I recently started training [here](http://sanfranciscocrossfit.com/). Great space and friendly people!

### Sailing
Can't say enough about [Cal Sailing](https://www.cal-sailing.org/) club! It's much more than just a sailing club. It's a community.
